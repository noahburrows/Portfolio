## Welcome to a portfolio of my work.

Here are a few examples of projects I've worked on:

### Todo Apps

![Todo](https://github.com/noahburrows/Portfolio/blob/main/Headshot.jpg?raw=true)
Simple apps to keep track of tasks that need to be done. This app was made using Flutter.

Mobile version of a todo app I called "TaskMan"

### Games and Mods
